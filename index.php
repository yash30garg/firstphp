Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffee plant.
 The genus Coffee is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.
 The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, 
 Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and hardier robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried.
 Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.

Coffee is slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, café latte, etc.).
 It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although there is generally poor quality of such studies.

The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines.
 It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee seeds were first exported from East Africa to Yemen, 
 as the coffea arabica plant is thought to have been indigenous to the former. Yemeni traders took coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century,
 it had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in  hole at the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds potential, about half fail to sprout.
 A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, 
 such  corn, beans, rice during the first few years of cultivation  farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a area between the tropics of Cancer Capricorn, termed the bean belt coffee belt.

Of the two  species grown, arabica coffee (from C. arabica) is generally more highly regarded than robusta coffee (from C. canephora); robusta tends to be bitter have less flavor but better body than arabica. these reasons, 
about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica.Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than arabica. Consequently, this species is used an inexpensive substitute arabica in many commercial coffee blends.
 Good quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste a better foam head (known  crema).

Additionally, Coffea canephora is less susceptible to disease than C. arabica can be cultivated in lower altitudes warmer climates where C. arabica will not thrive. The robusta strain was first collected in 1890 from the Lomani River,
 a tributary of the Congo River, was conveyed from the Congo Free State (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to Brussels to Java around 1900. From Java, further breeding resulted in the establishment of robusta plantations in many countries.
 In particular, the spread of the devastating coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), to which C. arabica is vulnerable, hastened the uptake of the resistant robusta. Coffee leaf rust is found in virtually all countries that produce coffee.
